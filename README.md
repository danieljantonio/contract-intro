# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

How to Execute the Scripts

1. Clone the Repo
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`
3. Run the hardhat node using `npx hardhat node`
4. Run the scripts using `ts-node scripts/scriptName.ts`
